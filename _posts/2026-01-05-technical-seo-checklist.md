## Why technical SEO still decides outcomes

Great content can still underperform if the site is slow, poorly indexed, or hard to crawl. I run this checklist before any serious SEO work.

## Crawl and index checks

- Robots.txt is accessible and accurate
- XML sitemap is clean and updated
- Canonical tags are consistent
- Noindex tags are used intentionally
- Important pages are in the index

## Performance checks

- LCP under 2.5 seconds
- CLS under 0.1
- TTFB under 800ms
- Images are compressed and next-gen formats used
- Caching and CDN are configured

## Architecture checks

- Shallow click depth for money pages
- Internal links connect related topics
- Broken links are fixed
- Redirect chains removed

## On-page technical hygiene

- H1 and title tags are unique
- Structured data validates
- Open Graph and Twitter cards present
- Pagination and filters handled properly

## Security and trust

- HTTPS everywhere
- No mixed content
- Safe browsing clean

## Final reminder

This checklist is not about perfection. It is about removing the blockers that stop your content from performing. Once those are fixed, SEO becomes much easier to scale.
