<h2>The old playbook is gone</h2>
                        <p>Pixel-only tracking under-reports results. You need first-party data and stronger measurement.</p>

                        <h2>What works now</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>CRM list uploads and lookalikes</li>
                            <li>Conversions API alongside pixel</li>
                            <li>Clear prospecting vs retargeting separation</li>
                            <li>Creative testing every 2 to 3 weeks</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Budget split I use</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>70 percent prospecting</li>
                            <li>20 percent retargeting</li>
                            <li>10 percent testing</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Measurement focus</h2>
                        <p>Cost per qualified lead, time-to-conversion, and branded search lift matter more than platform-only ROAS.</p>
