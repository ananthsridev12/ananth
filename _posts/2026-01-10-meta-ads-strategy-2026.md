## The old playbook is gone

After iOS privacy changes, pixel-only optimization is unreliable. If you still rely on last-click Facebook data, you are underreporting impact.

## What is working for me in 2026

1. **First-party data**
   Upload CRM lists and build lookalikes. It is still the strongest signal Meta has.
2. **Server-side tracking**
   Use Conversions API alongside the pixel. This improves event match quality.
3. **Clear funnel separation**
   Keep prospecting and retargeting separate. It stabilizes learning.
4. **Creative testing cadence**
   New creative every 2 to 3 weeks. Ads fatigue faster now.

## Campaign structure I use

- 70 percent budget to broad prospecting
- 20 percent to high-intent retargeting
- 10 percent to testing new angles

This keeps scale and learning balanced.

## Measurement approach

I look at:

- Cost per qualified lead
- Time-to-conversion window
- Lift in branded search traffic

If those are moving, Meta is working even if ROAS looks noisy.

## Common mistakes

- Too many ad sets and too little data per set
- No creative testing system
- Relying only on platform attribution

## Final thought

Meta still works, but it is a creative and data problem now, not a targeting hack. The brands that win are the ones who test faster and track better.
