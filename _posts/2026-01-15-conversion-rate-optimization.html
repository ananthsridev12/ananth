<h2>Step 1: diagnose with evidence</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Funnel drop-off analysis</li>
                            <li>Landing page engagement metrics</li>
                            <li>Heatmaps and recordings</li>
                            <li>Form analytics</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Step 2: prioritize with impact and effort</h2>
                        <p>I rank tests by expected impact, effort, and confidence based on data quality.</p>

                        <h2>Step 3: write a clear hypothesis</h2>
                        <p>"If we change X, then Y will improve because Z." If I cannot write that, the test is not ready.</p>

                        <h2>Step 4: run clean experiments</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Single major variable per test</li>
                            <li>Statistical sample sizes</li>
                            <li>Run long enough for weekly patterns</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Step 5: document and loop</h2>
                        <p>Wins and losses both feed the AI reporting layer. Documentation compounds over time.</p>
