## CRO is a system, not a hack

CRO works when it is structured. Random A/B tests do not scale. I use a repeatable framework that combines analytics, user behavior, and business context.

## Step 1: diagnose with data

I start with:

- Funnel drop-off analysis
- Landing page engagement metrics
- Heatmaps and session recordings
- Form analytics

This shows where friction exists and what needs to change first.

## Step 2: prioritize with impact and effort

I rank tests based on:

- Expected impact on conversions
- Implementation effort
- Confidence based on evidence

This keeps the roadmap focused and realistic.

## Step 3: design a single clear hypothesis

Every test gets a hypothesis:

"If we change X, then Y will improve because Z."

If I cannot write that sentence, the test is not ready.

## Step 4: run clean experiments

- Use statistically sound sample sizes
- Change one major variable at a time
- Run tests long enough to capture weekly patterns

## Step 5: document and iterate

Win or lose, I document the learning. The insights are what compound over time.

## My favorite CRO quick wins

- Shorter forms with better field order
- Clearer above-the-fold value props
- Stronger CTA contrast and copy
- Social proof near key CTAs

## Final note

CRO is not about guessing. It is about building evidence. When you treat it like a system, conversion gains become predictable.
