## Automation wins when timing matters

Manual emails are inconsistent and slow. Automation lets you trigger the right message based on real behavior. These seven workflows are the ones I use most often.

## 1. Welcome sequence

New subscriber? Send a short, high-value sequence that sets expectations and delivers quick wins.

## 2. Lead magnet delivery + follow-up

Deliver the asset instantly, then follow up with two or three emails that deepen the topic and invite a call or demo.

## 3. Abandoned form recovery

If someone starts a form and drops, send a reminder within 24 hours with a single CTA.

## 4. Content nurture loop

Send one useful piece of content per week for four weeks. End the sequence with a strong offer.

## 5. Trial activation

For SaaS, I focus on early wins: onboarding steps, key features, and “first value” moments.

## 6. Post-purchase education

Teach the customer how to get more value after they buy. This reduces churn and increases repeat sales.

## 7. Re-engagement

If a lead goes cold, a 3-email reactivation series can bring them back at low cost.

## My setup process

- Define the trigger and the exit condition
- Write 3 to 5 emails per sequence
- Keep CTAs single and clear
- Test subject lines early

## Final thought

Automation is not about sending more emails. It is about sending fewer, smarter emails that match the user’s intent.
