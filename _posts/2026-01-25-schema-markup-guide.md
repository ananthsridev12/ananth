## Why schema matters now

Schema does not directly boost rankings, but it boosts visibility. Rich results increase CTR and qualify traffic. That is why I prioritize schema in every technical SEO audit.

## The schemas I use most

- Organization
- Person
- Article
- FAQ
- Breadcrumb
- Product (for e-commerce)
- Service (for agencies and B2B)

These cover 90 percent of real-world needs.

## Implementation checklist

1. Start with Organization and Person schema on the homepage.
2. Add Article schema to blog posts.
3. Use FAQ schema for pages with clear questions and answers.
4. Validate in Google’s Rich Results Test.
5. Monitor coverage in Search Console.

## Avoiding common pitfalls

- Do not add FAQ schema to thin pages.
- Avoid marking up content that is not visible.
- Keep author and publish dates accurate.
- Use JSON-LD, not microdata.

## How I measure schema impact

I track:

- Rich result impressions and CTR in Search Console
- Ranking movements for schema-enabled pages
- Time on page and scroll depth

Schema should improve both visibility and engagement. If it does not, I revisit the content quality, not the markup.

## Final take

Schema is a multiplier. It will not save weak content, but it will elevate strong content. Implement it once, validate it properly, and let it compound.
