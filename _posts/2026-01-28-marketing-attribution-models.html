<h2>Attribution is about decision quality</h2>
                        <p>The right model depends on your funnel maturity, conversion volume, and data cleanliness.</p>

                        <h2>Quick model guide</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First-click for early acquisition</li>
                            <li>Last-click for simplicity</li>
                            <li>Linear for balanced journeys</li>
                            <li>Time decay for recency-heavy funnels</li>
                            <li>Position-based for first/last emphasis</li>
                            <li>Data-driven when volume is high</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>My decision framework</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Early-stage: First-click or position-based</li>
                            <li>Mid-stage: Linear or time decay</li>
                            <li>Mature: Data-driven with stable tracking</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>AI-era pitfall</h2>
                        <p>AI reporting can make weak data look confident. If tracking is inconsistent, use simpler models.</p>

                        <h2>Recommendation</h2>
                        <p>Lock the model for a quarter, then adjust based on business changes.</p>
