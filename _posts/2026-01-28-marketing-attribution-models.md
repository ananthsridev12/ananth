## Attribution is not one-size-fits-all

Attribution is about truth, not convenience. The model you choose should match your sales cycle, channel mix, and data quality.

I pick a model based on how mature the funnel is. Here is how I decide.

## Quick model overview

- **First-click**: best for early-stage awareness campaigns
- **Last-click**: simple, but hides upper-funnel impact
- **Linear**: gives equal credit across the journey
- **Time decay**: more credit to recent touchpoints
- **Position-based**: emphasizes first and last touch
- **Data-driven**: uses actual conversion data

## My decision framework

1. **Early-stage brands**: First-click or position-based to understand acquisition.
2. **Mid-stage brands**: Linear or time-decay for balance.
3. **Mature brands with volume**: Data-driven if enough conversions exist.

If the data is weak, data-driven can mislead. I would rather use a simple model and trust it than a complex model built on noise.

## The common mistake

The biggest mistake is switching models every month. It makes trends impossible to interpret.

I lock a model for a quarter, monitor results, then adjust if the business changes.

## What I report internally

Even with a single model, I compare two views:

- **Primary attribution model** for KPIs
- **Last-click sanity check** for anomaly detection

This keeps the team grounded while still giving strategic insights.

## My advice

Pick the model that best reflects your growth stage and stick with it long enough to learn. Attribution is useful only when it is consistent.
