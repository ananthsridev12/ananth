## Automation is not a strategy

Automation can amplify good structure and good data. It can also amplify chaos. I have seen both.

My rule: automation works best when inputs are clean. If your conversion tracking is messy, or your account structure is confused, Smart Bidding will optimize the wrong thing at scale.

## When I recommend automation

I flip on automation when these conditions are true:

- Conversion tracking is accurate and stable
- There is enough volume (at least 30 to 50 conversions per month)
- The offer and landing pages are proven
- I can clearly define the primary conversion event

In these situations, `Maximize Conversions` or `Target CPA` usually outperforms manual bidding.

## When I keep manual control

I stay manual when:

- Conversion volume is low
- The business has long sales cycles and poor offline tracking
- Budget is limited and testing needs to be precise
- The conversion signal is noisy or inconsistent

In these cases, manual CPC or enhanced CPC gives more control while data matures.

## The middle ground: smart structure + limited automation

If I am not ready for full automation, I still use smart features:

- Automated ad rotations for better CTR
- Responsive Search Ads with controlled assets
- Audience signals to guide learning

This gives Google enough data while keeping the campaign grounded.

## The KPI that matters most

I do not judge automation on CTR or impressions. I judge it on **cost per qualified lead** and **conversion rate**. If automation improves those two, it is working. If not, I pull back.

## Common automation mistakes

1. **Switching too early**
   Let manual campaigns collect clean data first.
2. **Using the wrong conversion event**
   Track actual leads, not button clicks.
3. **Ignoring search terms**
   Automation still needs negative keyword hygiene.

## My workflow

1. Validate tracking (GA4 + GTM + Ads).
2. Start with manual or eCPC.
3. Hit stable conversion volume.
4. Move to Target CPA or ROAS.
5. Optimize weekly, not daily.

Automation is powerful, but it is not magic. It is a lever that only works if the machine behind it is clean.
