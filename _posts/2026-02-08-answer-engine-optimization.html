<h2>What AEO means in 2026</h2>
                        <p>Search is no longer just blue links. LLMs summarize, and your goal is to be the cited source behind the summary. That is AEO.</p>

                        <h2>Signals that matter to AI answers</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Direct, concise answers near the top</li>
                            <li>Clear entity relationships and author credibility</li>
                            <li>Structured data that exposes meaning</li>
                            <li>Topical depth across a cluster of pages</li>
                            <li>Freshness when topics change quickly</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Content structure that LLMs parse well</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Answer first in 2 to 3 sentences</li>
                            <li>Add context and constraints</li>
                            <li>Provide steps or a checklist</li>
                            <li>Back it with evidence or examples</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Schema for AI visibility</h2>
                        <p>I prioritize Organization, Person, Article, and FAQ schema because AI systems use those to understand entities and credibility.</p>

                        <h2>Build authority with clusters</h2>
                        <p>AEO works best when related posts link to each other. That is why I pair this with guides like <a href="schema-markup-guide.html">Schema Markup</a> and <a href="technical-seo-checklist.html">Technical SEO</a>.</p>

                        <h2>AEO checklist</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Exact question phrasing in H2</li>
                            <li>Answer in the first 150 words</li>
                            <li>FAQ schema where it fits</li>
                            <li>Author and date clearly visible</li>
                        </ul>
