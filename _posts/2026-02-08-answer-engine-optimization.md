## What AEO really means

Search is no longer just ten blue links. People are asking questions directly inside AI engines, and those engines answer with summaries, not page lists. Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is how I make sure a brand is cited, summarized, and trusted in those answers.

It is not a replacement for SEO. It is the next layer on top of it.

## The new ranking signals I pay attention to

AI engines prioritize clarity and trust. These are the signals I focus on:

- Clear, direct answers in the first 100 to 150 words
- Authoritative sources and citations
- Structured data for entities and relationships
- Consistent topical coverage across related pages
- Freshness for fast-moving topics

If your content is vague, overly promotional, or thin, it will be ignored.

## My AEO content structure

When I write or audit content for AEO, I use a simple structure:

1. **Direct answer at the top**: one to two paragraphs with the core insight.
2. **Context and nuance**: why the answer is true, and when it changes.
3. **Actionable steps**: checklists, frameworks, and examples.
4. **Proof and references**: data, benchmarks, and real outcomes.

This format works for both users and AI systems because it is easy to parse.

## Entities and schema are now table stakes

AEO is heavily entity-driven. If your brand, services, and expertise are not tied to clear entities, the AI does not know how to connect you to the query.

I implement:

- Organization, Person, and Service schema
- FAQ schema for targeted answers
- Article schema with author and publish dates
- Internal linking between entity clusters

The goal is to make it obvious who you are and what you solve.

## Build topical authority with clusters

I use topic clusters to send strong relevance signals. Example for analytics:

- GA4 migration guide
- Event tracking framework
- GTM data layer best practices
- BigQuery export setup

When these pages link to each other, AI engines see depth, not just one-off posts.

## Practical AEO checklist

- Write the answer first, not the story.
- Use exact question phrasing in H2 or H3.
- Include a short, scannable list.
- Add schema for FAQs or HowTo where relevant.
- Keep your author bio and credentials visible.

## My take

AEO is about clarity and credibility. If your content is genuinely useful and structured well, you will show up more often in AI results. If it is vague and salesy, you will not.

The brands winning right now are not those with more content. They are the ones with better answers.
