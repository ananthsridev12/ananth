<h2>Why GA4 migration matters now</h2>
                        <p>UA is sunset, and AI-driven reporting depends on clean, consistent data. If your GA4 setup is messy, every automated insight and bidding model will optimize the wrong signal.</p>

                        <h2>The shift: sessions to events</h2>
                        <p>GA4 is event-first. To make it AI-friendly, events must be consistent and meaningful.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Core events: page_view, form_submit, generate_lead, purchase</li>
                            <li>Context parameters: page_title, page_location, button_text, value</li>
                            <li>User properties: customer_type, plan_tier, lifecycle_stage</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Step 1: design the measurement plan</h2>
                        <p>I start by mapping the funnel and defining a small set of business outcomes. This avoids the common track everything mess that kills reporting quality.</p>

                        <h2>Step 2: build a clean data layer</h2>
                        <p>Structured data layers make GA4 reliable and reusable. They also make it easier for AI tools to interpret intent and outcomes.</p>

                        <h2>Step 3: implement with GTM</h2>
                        <p>GTM lets you deploy events without code changes and gives you a consistent QA workflow. If you use server-side tagging, you also improve attribution reliability.</p>

                        <h2>Step 4: choose conversions carefully</h2>
                        <p>Pick 3 to 5 conversions that actually represent revenue or pipeline. AI bidding depends on clean conversion data, so this is non-negotiable.</p>

                        <h2>Step 5: connect GA4 to your AI stack</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enable BigQuery export for raw data access</li>
                            <li>Sync GA4 with Ads, Search Console, and CRM</li>
                            <li>Standardize UTM naming for model accuracy</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>AI-era reporting checklist</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Event names are human-readable</li>
                            <li>Parameters are consistent across pages</li>
                            <li>Consent mode is configured correctly</li>
                            <li>Internal traffic is filtered</li>
                        </ul>
