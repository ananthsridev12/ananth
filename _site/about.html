                <p class="section-subtitle">
                    From social media to performance marketing to analyticsâ€”my journey has been about connecting the dots between data and growth.

                <div class="about-story">
                    <p>
                        I started my digital marketing career back in 2013, managing Facebook pages and local TV ads. What began as content publishing quickly evolved into a deeper fascination with <strong>how marketing actually works</strong>â€”the metrics, the testing, the optimization loops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the years, I moved from <strong>social media execution</strong> to <strong>performance marketing</strong>, then into <strong>technical SEO and analytics</strong>. Along the way, I discovered that the real magic happens when you combine creative strategy with data-driven execution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I specialize in building <strong>end-to-end marketing systems</strong>â€”from tracking setup and campaign execution to CRM automation and conversion optimization. I've helped fintech platforms scale lead generation, e-commerce brands grow organic traffic, and B2B companies build predictable pipelines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What sets me apart? I don't just run campaignsâ€”I build infrastructure. I set up analytics properly, optimize for long-term visibility, and automate workflows that keep marketing scalable. <strong>Data + Execution + Automation</strong>â€”that's my formula.
